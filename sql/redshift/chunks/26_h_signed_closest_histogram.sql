-- 26) H. Metastasis-to-treatment timing (Part 2, histogram) <U+2014> the signed
--     distribution of each treated patient's CLOSEST antineoplastic treatment
--     relative to the first Metastasis.
--     Over the treated MET patients (>= 1 L01 record), each patient is reduced to
--     the single signed days_diff of their CLOSEST L01 record (same value and
--     convention as chunk 24) and placed in one signed-day bin. Before and after
--     are separate; day 0 is its own central bin. bin_order runs left to right
--     along the signed axis (farthest before -> day 0 -> farthest after) so the
--     report renders the bars directly.

--
--     The 366+ terminal bins carry everything beyond one year on each side. The bin
--     share (n_patients / n_treated_total) is what the report plots.
--
--     NOTE (relationship to the after-curve, chunk 28). This histogram is entirely
--     CLOSEST-based: the after bins (order 8-13) sum to the closest-after patients
--     (chunk 25 n_closest_after), NOT to the after-curve population (n_after_any).
--     The after-curve is intentionally over a broader population and is therefore
--     NOT the cumulative of these after bars. The before bins (order 1-6) sum to the
--     closest-before patients and DO agree with the before-curve (chunk 27).
--
--     Denominator (n_treated_total, repeated on each row):
--       treated MET patients = before + day0 + after (= chunk 24 sum of the three
--       treated categories; = chunk 25 n_treated).
--
--     Population, observation-period and L01-source notes: same as chunk 24
--     (DX-anchored MET population from #met_events; L01 from #l01_events, gated to the
--     same #anchor_person cohort; no observation-period gate). No change to 00_setup.sql.
--
--     Small-cell suppression: n_patients in (0, @min_cell_count] set to
--     -@min_cell_count. n_treated_total is an aggregate denominator, not
--     suppressed. A bin with zero patients is absent (as in chunks 18-25).
