-- 19) F. Index event record counts (part 2) <U+2014> on what timescale the code repeats
--     For patients with more than one Diagnosis code, the time between
--     consecutive Diagnosis codes, for the first two transitions only:
--       DX_1_TO_2 : first Diagnosis day  -> second Diagnosis day
--       DX_2_TO_3 : second Diagnosis day -> third  Diagnosis day
--     bucketed by timeframe: within 30 days / 31 to 90 / 91 to 365 / more than a year.
--
--     JUDGMENT CALL (flag for review): "consecutive codes" is measured between
--     DISTINCT Diagnosis DAYS, not raw records. Same-day duplicate records are
--     collapsed first (SELECT DISTINCT person_id, event_date), mirroring the L01
--     gap methodology (#l01_event_days in 00_setup.sql). Counting raw records
--     instead would make almost every first-to-second gap 0 days (same-day
--     administrative duplicates) and hide the coding timescale. Consequently
--     every gap is >= 1 day and the "within 30 days" bucket is 1-30 days.
--     Part 1 (chunk 18) counts records; this part measures timing between days.
--
--     Denominators (n_transitions_total, per transition = patients, since each
--     patient contributes at most one gap per transition):
--       DX_1_TO_2 = patients with >= 2 distinct Diagnosis days
--       DX_2_TO_3 = patients with >= 3 distinct Diagnosis days
--     Source: #dx_events restricted to #cohort (00_setup.sql).
--     Small-cell suppression: n_transitions in (0, @min_cell_count] set to
--     -@min_cell_count. n_transitions_total is an aggregate denominator, not suppressed.
