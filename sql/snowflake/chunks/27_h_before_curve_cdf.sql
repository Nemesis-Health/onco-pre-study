-- 27) H. Metastasis-to-treatment timing (Part 2, before-curve) <U+2014> cumulative reach
--     of the CLOSEST-before treatment, over the closest-before patients.
--     Over the patients whose CLOSEST antineoplastic (L01) record is strictly
--     before the first Metastasis (chunk 24 CLOSEST_L01_BEFORE_MET), the number
--     whose closest-before record sits WITHIN each day threshold before the first
--     MET. Cumulative and monotonically non-decreasing across thresholds. Reads
--     "how far back the nearest before-MET treatment sits":
--
--       n_within_30d_before, _60d, _90d, _180d, _365d
--
--     days_before = ABS(days_diff) of the closest record (all values >= 1 by
--     construction; day 0 is a separate central category, not on this curve). The
--     curve is CLOSEST-based, so it agrees with the histogram's before bars
--     (chunk 26, bin_order 1-6). Patients whose closest-before treatment is more
--     than 365 days before the MET are the earlier-than-one-year tail, derivable as
--     n_before_total - n_within_365d_before.
--
--     median_days_before_closest: median days_before among the same patients, using
--     the framework's ordered-set median convention (lower-middle value for even n,
--     as in chunks 16-17, 23 and 00_setup.sql).
--
--     Denominator (n_before_total):
--       closest-before patients (= chunk 24 CLOSEST_L01_BEFORE_MET n_patients).
--
--     NOTE (direction). This is the BEFORE curve. It reads leftward (backward in
--     time) from the first MET and uses its own directional denominator; it is
--     never combined with the after-curve into a symmetric window.
--
--     Population, observation-period and L01-source notes: same as chunk 24
--     (DX-anchored MET population from #met_events; L01 from #l01_events, gated to the
--     same #anchor_person cohort; no observation-period gate). No change to 00_setup.sql.
--
--     Small-cell suppression: each cumulative count in (0, @min_cell_count] set to
--     -@min_cell_count; median set to NULL when its denominator is suppressed.
--     n_before_total is an aggregate denominator, not suppressed.
