-- 6) Directional ODX / GDX concept prevalence relative to the anchor date, at
--    fixed clinical time points, with before and after kept strictly separate and
--    day 0 as its own category. Replaces the earlier symmetric (+/-) windowed
--    output (the +/- windows conflated pre- and post-anchor coding, which have
--    different clinical meaning for exclusion-criteria design).
--
--    For each anchor / event family / concept this counts DISTINCT PATIENTS by
--    where the code sits in time relative to the anchor. Before and after are
--    never combined into a symmetric window. The event closest to the anchor on
--    each side places the patient into exactly one before band and/or one after
--    band, so within a side the bands partition that side's patients. This is the
--    disjoint-band "quick scan" companion to the cumulative CDF in chunk 06b.
--
--    Anchors (framework two-anchor convention, both surfaced):
--      INDEX     : DX index_date (full DX cohort, #cohort)
--      FIRST_MET : first_met_date (MET subgroup only; patients with a first MET)
--
--    Event families:
--      ODX : other specific cancer diagnoses (competing-cancer exclusion codes)
--      GDX : general / non-specific cancer diagnoses (broad ancestor codes)
--
--    days = DATEDIFF(DAY, anchor_date, event_date). Bands are placed on the event
--    CLOSEST to the anchor on each side (nearest-before for the before bands,
--    nearest-after for the after bands):
--      before side (days <= -1), by days-before = -days of the closest-before event:
--        n_before_gt730   : > 730 days before  (more than 2 yr)
--        n_before_366_730 : 366-730 days before (1-2 yr)
--        n_before_181_365 : 181-365 days before
--        n_before_91_180  : 91-180 days before
--        n_before_31_90   : 31-90 days before
--        n_before_1_30    : 1-30 days before
--      day 0 (its own category, never folded into before or after):
--        n_day0           : an event on the anchor day (days = 0)
--      after side (days >= 1), by days-after of the closest-after event:
--        n_after_1_30 ... n_after_gt730 : mirror of the before bands, forward
--    Side totals (each = the sum of that side's bands = any event on that side):
--        n_before_ever, n_after_ever
--    Overall:
--        n_ever : distinct patients with any event of the concept at any time.
--
--    n_ever is NOT the sum of the columns: one patient may have events before,
--    on, and after the anchor and so appear in a before band, in n_day0, and in
--    an after band. Within a single side the bands ARE a clean partition
--    (n_before_ever = sum of before bands; n_after_ever = sum of after bands).
--
--    Covers ODX and GDX. All concepts are reported; the report builder limits to
--    top N by n_ever.
--
--    Small-cell suppression: each count in (0, @min_cell_count] set to
--    -@min_cell_count.
