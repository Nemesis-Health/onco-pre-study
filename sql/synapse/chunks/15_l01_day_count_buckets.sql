-- 15) Distribution of distinct L01 event days per patient
--     Shows how many patients have 1, 2-6, 7-11, or 12+ distinct L01 days.
--     Patients with exactly 1 day cannot contribute to gap analyses (chunks 11-12).
--     Source: #l01_event_days (built in 00_setup.sql section L).
--
--     Two subgroups:
--       ALL_L01 : all DX cohort patients with any L01 record
--       MET_L01 : patients who also have a first_met_date
--     Small-cell suppression: n_patients <= @min_cell_count suppressed to -@min_cell_count.
