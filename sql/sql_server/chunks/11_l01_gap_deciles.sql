-- 11) L01 consecutive record gap distribution — decile summary
--     Intermediate tables #l01_event_days and #l01_consecutive_gaps are
--     built in 00_setup.sql (section L).
--
--     Two subgroups:
--       ALL_L01 : all DX cohort patients with any L01 record
--       MET_L01 : patients who also have a first_met_date
--
--     Output: one row per subgroup with gap-day deciles.
