-- WARNING: This dialect (pdw) does not support native session
--   temp tables.  Supply a tempEmulationSchema when calling
--   SqlRender::translate() / DatabaseConnector::executeSql().
--   Without it, #temp table references become permanent tables and
--   may cause permission errors or name collisions.

-- 6b) Directional ODX / GDX prevalence expressed CUMULATIVELY (CDF-style), so an
--     exclusion look-back (before) or follow-up (after) cutoff can be read off
--     directly. Cumulative companion to the disjoint bands in chunk 06; same
--     population, same closest-event-per-side construction, same two anchors.
--
--     For each anchor / event family / concept, the number of DISTINCT PATIENTS
--     whose closest event on a side sits WITHIN each day threshold of the anchor.
--     Because a patient counts as "within X" whenever ANY event on that side is
--     within X days of the anchor, n_within_Xd_before is exactly the number of
--     patients an X-day look-back exclusion would capture for this concept.
--     Counts are cumulative and monotonically non-decreasing across thresholds.
--
--     Anchors (both surfaced): INDEX (DX index_date, full DX cohort) and
--     FIRST_MET (first_met_date, MET subgroup only).
--     Families: ODX (other specific cancer dx), GDX (general / non-specific).
--     days = DATEDIFF(DAY, anchor_date, event_date); before = days <= -1,
--     after = days >= 1, day 0 its own category (never folded into a side).
--
--     Columns:
--       n_ever            : distinct patients with any event of the concept, any time.
--       n_before_ever     : distinct patients with any event before the anchor
--                           (the denominator for the before CDF; the tail beyond
--                           2 yr is n_before_ever - n_within_730d_before).
--       n_within_30d_before ... n_within_730d_before : cumulative before counts
--                           (patients with a before event within 30/90/180/365/730 days).
--       median_days_before: median of days-before over patients with any before
--                           event, days-before = distance of the closest-before
--                           event; framework ordered-set median convention
--                           (lower-middle for even n, as in chunks 16-17, 23, 27-28).
--       n_day0            : distinct patients with an event on the anchor day.
--       n_after_ever, n_within_30d_after ... n_within_730d_after, median_days_after:
--                           mirror of the before columns on the after side.
--
--     Covers ODX and GDX. All concepts reported; report builder limits to top N.
--
--     Small-cell suppression: each count in (0, @min_cell_count] set to
--     -@min_cell_count; a side median set to NULL when that side's denominator
--     (n_before_ever / n_after_ever) is <= @min_cell_count.
