-- 32) G. Drug Therapy procedure characterization, part 3. Does an antineoplastic
--     drug_exposure sit near the Drug Therapy procedure, per procedure concept.
--     For patients who carry a Drug Therapy procedure (DTP) of a given concept root,
--     the number who also have an antineoplastic (L01) drug_exposure record within a
--     fixed window of the procedure date. Directional: a drug_exposure in the window
--     BEFORE the procedure, ON the procedure day (day 0), and in the window AFTER the
--     procedure are counted separately and never combined into one symmetric window.
--     All candidate window widths are emitted in one row so the report / UI can read
--     off any before/after pair:
--
--       n_patients_with_procedure   patients carrying this DTP concept root
--                                    (the row denominator)
--       n_drugexp_le{7,14,30,90}d_before
--                                    of those, how many have an L01 record whose
--                                    closest occurrence before a procedure of this
--                                    root is within 7 / 14 / 30 / 90 days
--       n_drugexp_on_day0            how many have an L01 record on a procedure day
--       n_drugexp_le{7,14,30,90}d_after
--                                    closest L01 after a procedure within 7/14/30/90 d
--       n_drugexp_ever               how many have any L01 record at any time (context)
--
--     Timing is measured from EACH procedure of the root: a patient counts in the
--     "within N days before" column if any of their L01 records falls 1..N days
--     before any of their procedures of that root (via the closest such record).
--     The before / day-0 / after columns can overlap for a patient, so they need not
--     sum. A high share means the procedure is corroborated by the drug table and
--     adds little new capture; a low share means the procedure is largely the only
--     record that treatment happened for that concept.
--
--     Denominator (n_patients_with_procedure, per row):
--       patients who carry a Drug Therapy procedure of this concept root WITHIN the
--       DX-anchored cohort (they also carry an anchor DX code). Part 3 characterizes
--       procedure/drug redundancy per concept root, across the cohort rather than
--       only the metastatic subset, so its per-concept denominators exceed the MET
--       count but are still bounded by the DX-anchored cohort.
--
--     JUDGMENT CALL / FLAG (DX-anchoring, changed in this revision). This chunk now
--     restricts both the DTP procedures and the L01 records to the DX-anchored cohort
--     (#anchor_person), the same entry point as every other analysis in the package.
--     Previously it read procedure_occurrence and drug_exposure UNGATED over all
--     persons, including patients with no anchor cancer DX at all. Under the corrected
--     foundational principle (every patient in this analysis carries an anchor DX code
--     by construction), a Drug Therapy procedure or L01 record in a patient with no
--     anchor DX gives no evidence about the cancer of interest's coding, the same
--     argument that governs the Metastasis population in Analyses D, G-part-1 and H.
--     Restricting to #anchor_person makes G-part-3 consistent with that principle.
--     Note this does change the per-concept denominators versus the earlier ungated
--     output: they are now smaller (cohort-only). This chunk does NOT use the MET
--     population; MET-scoping would be wrong for a general procedure/drug redundancy
--     check, so the correct anchoring here is the DX cohort, not the MET subset. If
--     the intent is instead a cohort-independent instrument check (redundancy of the
--     procedure concept itself across the whole database), revert the three
--     #anchor_person joins below; flagged for AA rather than assumed.
--
--     JUDGMENT CALL / FLAG (observation period). Not restricted to an observation
--     period, consistent with the rest of Analyses D, G and H. Anchored on
--     #anchor_person (has an anchor DX code), not #cohort (DX inside an observation
--     period). See the report for the recommendation.
--
--     JUDGMENT CALL / FLAG (suppression of the per-concept denominator).
--     n_patients_with_procedure is itself a per-concept patient count, so it is
--     suppressed like the other per-concept cells (chunk 06 convention): a value in
--     (0, @min_cell_count] is set to -@min_cell_count. When it is suppressed the
--     report cannot form a share for that row, the intended disclosure-control
--     behaviour. Every co-occurrence count is suppressed the same way. A root carried
--     by zero patients is absent.
