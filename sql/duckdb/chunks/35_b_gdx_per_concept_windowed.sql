-- 35) B. General cancer diagnosis (GDX) coding trajectory <U+2014> part 3, per-concept
--     directional windowed counts. One row per general cancer diagnosis (broad /
--     non-specific ancestor) concept carried by the anchor cohort, with the number
--     of distinct cohort patients holding a code of that concept in each window
--     relative to the first specific Diagnosis (INDEX = #cohort.index_date). All
--     timing is directional with day 0 explicit:
--
--       days = general_code_date - first_specific_diagnosis_date
--
--     Columns (distinct patients holding >= 1 code of the concept in the region;
--     the three regions overlap, so before + at day 0 + after can exceed n_patients
--     because one patient may hold codes on more than one side):
--       n_patients        any time (the concept's overall patient count)
--       before side (strictly before, days < 0), cumulative outward from day 0:
--         n_before_30d   -30 <= days <= -1
--         n_before_90d, n_before_180d, n_before_365d
--         n_ever_before  days < 0 (no upper look-back bound)
--       n_at_day0         days = 0 (explicit central category)
--       after side (strictly after, days > 0), cumulative outward from day 0:
--         n_after_30d     1 <= days <= 30
--         n_after_90d, n_after_180d, n_after_365d
--         n_ever_after   days > 0 (no upper follow-up bound)
--
--     Purpose: exclusion-criteria safety at the concept level. Concepts carried
--     mostly BEFORE the first specific Diagnosis (high n_ever_before) are the ones a
--     naive "any malignant neoplasm" exclusion would wrongly remove; the report
--     builds an adjustable capture window from these directional counts.
--
--     JUDGMENT CALL / FLAG (directional vs the mock's modelled split). The approved
--     V3 mock supplied REAL HUS patient counts per concept (n_patients / ever, and
--     ever-before / ever-after) but MODELLED the by-window before/after split from
--     symmetric +/-30/90/180/365 counts because a directional windowed output did
--     not yet exist. This chunk produces that directional output directly: the
--     before and after windows are true strictly-before and strictly-after counts,
--     not a modelled split of a symmetric window, and day 0 is its own separate
--     mass. Two columns reconcile exactly to the mock's real counts: n_patients
--     matches the mock "ever" (e.g. Malignant tumor of kidney 368, Primary malignant
--     neoplasm of urinary system 57) and n_ever_before matches the mock ever-before
--     (kidney 164, urinary system 14). n_ever_after here is strictly after (days > 0)
--     with day 0 carved out into n_at_day0, so it is <= the mock's ever-after, which
--     used days >= 0; this is the intended day-0-explicit correction.
--
--     JUDGMENT CALL / FLAG (concept coverage and the >10 filter). All general
--     cancer diagnosis concepts present in the cohort are emitted, each cell
--     small-cell suppressed, matching chunk 06's behaviour. The approved mock's
--     "more than 10 patients" cut-off is an adjustable DISPLAY threshold applied by
--     the report builder, not a hard filter here, so the report can raise or lower
--     it without re-running SQL.
--
--     JUDGMENT CALL / FLAG (anchor). INDEX (first specific Diagnosis) only, matching
--     Analysis B's spec and the approved mock. General-code prevalence around the
--     first Metastasis is covered generically by chunk 06.
--
--     Denominator: n_patients per concept (on the row); the anchor-cohort total
--     (chunk 33 n_cohort_total) is the population base for the report's
--     percent-of-cohort figures.
--
--     Population note. #gen_cancer_events is restricted to anchor-cohort persons in
--     00_setup.sql and joined to #cohort here; general-code dates are not restricted
--     to an observation period, matching the mock.
--
--     Small-cell suppression: every count in (0, @min_cell_count] set to
--     -@min_cell_count.
