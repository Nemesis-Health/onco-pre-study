--   Without it, #temp table references become permanent tables and
--   may cause permission errors or name collisions.

-- 16) E. Observation-period characterization <U+2014> observability around the index
--     How much observable time each patient has BEFORE the index (look-back) and
--     AFTER the index (follow-up), reported as cumulative day-threshold counts:
--     the number of patients with fewer than 30 / 90 / 180 / 365 days of
--     observation on each side of the index. Look-back and follow-up are kept
--     strictly separate (one row per side); day 0 sits on the follow-up side
--     (follow-up = days from the index to the observation-period end, >= 0).
--
--     Observable time is measured inside the single observation period that
--     CONTAINS the anchor date, so both sides are contiguous observable time:
--       look-back_days = index_date - observation_period_start_date
--       follow-up_days = observation_period_end_date - index_date
--     A patient contributes only if the anchor date falls within one of their
--     observation periods. For INDEX this holds for every cohort patient by
--     construction (see #cohort in 00_setup.sql); for FIRST_MET it holds only
--     for patients whose first metastasis date is inside an observation period.
--
--     Two anchors: INDEX (first qualifying DX = cohort index date) and FIRST_MET
--     (first metastasis date). Source: #cohort, #met_summary (00_setup.sql) and
--     @cdm_database_schema.observation_period.
--     Small-cell suppression: threshold counts in (0, @min_cell_count] are set to
--     -@min_cell_count; median set to NULL when the group denominator is suppressed.
--     n_patients is an aggregate cohort denominator and is not suppressed, matching
--     the existing death/prevalence chunks.
