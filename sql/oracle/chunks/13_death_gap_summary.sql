-- WARNING: This dialect (oracle) does not support native session

--   Without it, #temp table references become permanent tables and

-- 13) Death date vs observation period alignment — summary counts
--     For patients in the DX cohort (and the FIRST_MET subgroup), reports:
--       - n_death_before_obs : death_date < first observation_period_start
--                              (data quality error — rare but important)
--       - n_death_after_obs  : death_date > last  observation_period_end
--                              (gap distribution summarized in chunk 14)
--       - lq/median/uq/p90 percentiles of the post-obs gap (days).
--
--     Stratified by anchor (INDEX / FIRST_MET).
--     Small-cell suppression: n_death_before_obs and n_death_after_obs use -@min_cell_count
--     when suppressed; percentile columns are set to NULL when n_death_after_obs is suppressed.
