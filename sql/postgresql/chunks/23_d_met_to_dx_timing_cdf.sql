-- 23) D. MET-first subgroup, part 3b. The same MET-to-first-specific-DX gap as
--     chunk 22, expressed cumulatively (CDF) so a linking cutoff can be read off
--     directly, plus the median gap.
--     For the MET_FIRST_THEN_DX group of chunk 20, the number of patients whose
--     first specific DX has ARRIVED BY each day threshold after the first MET.
--     Cumulative and monotonically non-decreasing across thresholds:
--
--       n_arrived_by_30d, _45d, _60d, _90d, _180d, _365d
--
--     Thresholds 30/45/60/90 are the candidate cutoffs; 180/365 give the longer
--     shape. All time is AFTER the first MET by construction, so there is no before
--     side and no day-0 mass. Patients whose specific DX arrives after 365 days are
--     the >1-year tail, derivable as n_patients_reaching_dx_total - n_arrived_by_365d.
--
--     median_days_met_to_dx: median gap (days) among the same patients, using the
--     framework's ordered-set median convention (lower-middle value for even n, as
--     in chunks 16-17 and 00_setup.sql).
--
--     Denominator (n_patients_reaching_dx_total):
--       MET-first patients who reach a specific DX (same as chunk 22). Under the
--       corrected DX-anchored population every MET-first patient reaches a specific
--       DX, so this equals the full MET-first subgroup.
--
--     Population and observation-period notes: same as chunk 20 (DX-anchored MET
--     population from #met_events, first specific DX from #dx_events, anchored on
--     #anchor_person, no observation-period gate).
--
--     Small-cell suppression: each cumulative count in (0, @min_cell_count] set to
--     -@min_cell_count; median set to NULL when its denominator is suppressed.
--     n_patients_reaching_dx_total is an aggregate denominator, not suppressed.
